Proposal:  The Financial Crisis of 2008 had a far reaching impact on the US economy and the economy of the world.  Our team decided to explore the impact of the financial crisis on the livestock market in a sampling of 15 countries of various sizes and GDP, imports and exports in particular.  We looked at the impact of the crisis on amount of imports and exports and which commodities were effected.

Questions/Tasks
1) In what way did the crisis affect the overall volume of imports and exports?
2) In what way did the crisis affect the allocation of commodities?
3) In what ways did the magnitude of the crisis on each country proportionally affect their imports and exports?
  -group by country
  -track gdp by country and cross compare to import/export to find impact of crisis

Tasks:
1) Munging data, track trends, charts
2) grouping by commodity -charting allocation of resources over time
3) Munging data, track trends, charts
4) Coparing data from 2) and 3) against gdp number and charting
