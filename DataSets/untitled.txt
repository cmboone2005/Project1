What effect, if any, did the 2008 economic downturn have on Livestock Import/Export in the US?

Is there any correlation overall between GDP change and import/export numbers?
Is there any correlation between GDP overall volume and import/export numbers? (Do we import/export more to high or low gdp economies.)
Is there any relationship between rise in import/export to one country and fall in import/export in another?
